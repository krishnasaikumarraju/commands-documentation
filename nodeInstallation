good reference link for node and nvm:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu make through of it.

nodejs installation :
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nodejs(to install node updated version i.e 10.11.0)
sudo n 6.11.2 (to install specific version) check the version get installed or not

checking version:
node -v


npm usage:
npm -v (check npm version it is dependent of node)
no need to install npm seperately it is dependent of node(it gets installed based on node version as well version of npm is used based on node)

nvm usage:
Node Version Manager is a simple script to manage all of your active nodejs versions, with functionality such as: installation, executing commands with specific node.js versions, setting the PATH variable to use a specific node.js version.

installation:
run the below command in terminal(The installer can use git, curl, or wget to download nvm, whatever is available.)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

On Linux, after running the install script, if you get nvm: command not found or see no feedback from your terminal after you type:

command -v nvm

simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again installed version(i.e nvm -v).



Regular Commands of nvm(after installation process done):

nvm ls(to display node list in ths listed versions current active version is highlighted)
nvm -v (to check active nvm version)
nvm use v6.1 (from the listed versions of node you can select it based on requirement for the particular path)

example try (default):
nvm alias default v6.11.1 (you can set nvm default version)
nvm use v4.0.0(to use particular version of node)


errors:
If you get an error or no output at all, close and reopen the terminal.

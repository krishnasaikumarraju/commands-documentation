when node version is properly installed then install using node package manager:

npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g angular-cli@1.0.0-beta.32(supports node version with 6.11.1)


now a days no where it is used in projects even official angularjs developers not providing any kind of documentation/support. reason for restricting of this version is that you can find much more improvements in later versions.
